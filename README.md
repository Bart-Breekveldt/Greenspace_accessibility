# Greenspace_accessibility
Greenspace_accessibility in global cities

Time at 6-7 GB RAM average 12m run

The road extraction file extracts from OSMnx road networks of 15 carefully chosen world cities on which to run the greenspace accessibility model.

The 2 km buffer is 1000m metre for equal park access for each grid within city boundaries and 1000 metre extra for clean shortest route calculation, which may exceed the initial 1000m park buffer.

For Denver, Colorado, United States, parts of the Adams and Amarapoe networks are added to the model to get a 'boxy' shape. Otherwise the fastest real world routes (i.e. from south east Denver to the Airport via Aurora) may not be available. For this box a buffer is also created for the equal park access.

The entrance model 1000m threshold is trained on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
Input files are parks from parknet, city boundaries, road_network, edges and nodes from OSM and 250m population grids

Comments:
-	Buffer of 25 meters for calling two parks as one.
-	After which exclude parks less than 0.04 ha.
-	Only include population grids exclusively in the Philadelphia boundaries (size <0.99 of max size, size deviates slightly with lon-lat)
-	Working with the entrance nodes with 25m buffer of the road network of the parks.
-	Parks accessible within one kilometer of driving
-	Buffer of one kilometer outside or parks and the road network to the Philadelphia boundaries to ensure equal opportunities for all population grids.
-	Only calculate the Dijkstra algorithm on parks within 1km Euclidean distance.
-	Any score is 1000 minus the distance of the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
-	Scores are aggregated on grids, parks and population.
-	Population grids with a population of 0 are exluded, there are no people which need park access. Working and recreational use of parks may be a topic of a further study.
-	Try both ways from grid to park and vice versa, we may encounter one way, walking and cycling often can be done both ways, parking in US cities is often available near the park. If both don't work (2 / 228000), use the next nearest park node for the path calculation
-	Use all roads, because close park access is most preferable for walking / cycling

The centroid model 1000m threshold is also trained on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. This is an earlier model compared to the entrance model which main difference is at the centroid model the road node closest to the park centroid is taken to calculate the park access, while at the entrance model all road nodes within a 25 metre buffer access is calculated.

The entrance model is much more massive than the centroid, performance upgrades are also part of the centroid model.
